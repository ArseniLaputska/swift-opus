# Swift Opus

[Swift](https://swift.org/) bindings for the [Opus audio codec](https://opus-codec.org/) on Apple platforms (iOS, tvOS, macOS, watchOS).

This package enables low-level Opus packet encoding and decoding to an `AVAudioPCMBuffer` suitable for playback via an `AVAudioEngine` and `AVAudioPlayerNode`. This was built for a now-defunct audio app for iOS and macOS, and runs reliably with multiple 48khz Opus audio channels over a typical 4G connection on modern iPhone devices.

## Installation
